      <h2>Introduction to AI and Why It's Important</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines that are capable of
        learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Unlike traditional programs that follow fixed rules, AI systems can
        analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p> <br>
      <p>AI is important because it enables automation at a scale and speed never seen before. From personalizing your
        online shopping to predicting weather patterns, AI helps businesses and individuals make smarter, faster
        decisions. As data becomes the world's most valuable resource, AI becomes the key tool for unlocking its
        potential.</p> <br>
        <h2>How AI Is Used in Different Fields</h2>
        <p>AI is not limited to robotics or sci-fi applications. Itâ€™s actively transforming nearly every major industry.
          Here are some of the most impactful fields:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI assists in diagnostics, personalized treatment, and drug discovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Enables personalized learning and automation of administrative tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Powers self-driving cars and optimizes traffic management systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Supports recommendation engines and demand forecasting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ethical Questions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI can inherit biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data raises concerns about data security and consent.</li>
          <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Automation threatens to replace many human jobs.</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomous Decision-Making:</strong> Raises accountability questions-who is responsible when AI makes a mistake?</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Use of AI in facial recognition and public tracking may violate civil liberties.</li>
        </ul>
